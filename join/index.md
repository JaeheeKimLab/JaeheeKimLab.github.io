## We are hiring!!! ##
We are seeking new members at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. Potential members of the lab are expected to have a strong background in quantitative sciences, and to be interested in research in biology and genetics that incorporates mathematical, statistical, and computational approaches. Please send all inquiries and applications to [Jaehee Kim](mailto:jaehee.kim@cornell.edu).


### Postdoctoral Fellows
**Current openings**:
* [Postdoctoral Associates on Statistical Modeling of Genetic Epidemiology](/join/openings/)
* A postdoctoral position in other research areas is also available.  

Strong candidates will likely have either:
* PhD in a quantitative / computational field: mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, or a related field. Experience with biological or clinical data is preferred but not required.
* PhD in the biological sciences and a strong quantitative background.

To apply, please email me the following info.
* Research statement that includes your research interests and the type of projects you would like to pursue in the lab.
* Current CV.
* Code samples or links to published/distributed code.
* Names and contacts for three references.


### Graduate Students
*  Prospective graduate students with quantitative background can apply to the graduate program of the following fields:
    * [Computational Biology](https://compbio.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}
    * [Statistics](https://stat.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    * [Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}
    * [Genetics, Genomics and Development](https://gendev.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}  
    * [Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology and Medicine (CBM)](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/programs/tri-institutional-phd-programs){:target="_blank"} Weill Cornell Medicine). 
    
    For students specifically interested in the lab, please notify me in advance about your application. 
* For current graduate students at Cornell interested in the lab, please send me CV and a short description of research interest.


### Undergraduate Students
Highly motivated undergraduate students with strong mathematical or computational backgrounds are encouraged to email an inquiry to [Jaehee](mailto:jaehee.kim@cornell.edu). Please include a transcript (unofficial transcripts are acceptable), a CV, and a brief description of your research interests. Ideal candidates will have completed several 4000-level courses in pertinent fields such as STSCI, MATH, CS, BTRY, or their equivalents.
