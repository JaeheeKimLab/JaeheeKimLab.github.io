### Position Description
We are seeking **two postdoctoral researchers** to work on the genetic epidemiology of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) at Cornell University. The project aims to develop population-genetic models and phylodynamic statistical inference frameworks, and apply the developed methods to whole-genome sequencing data with its associated metadata for studying evolutionary processes and disease transmissions of Mtb. We are especially interested in candidates with experience in Bayesian inference methods. However, there is flexibility regarding the theoretical approaches used, and the postdocs will have the freedom to devise a creative computational framework for the project. 

The postdocs will be co-advised by three PIs—Jaehee Kim, Andrew Clark, and Martin Wells—across the Department of Computational Biology and Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. The postdocs will also work in close collaboration with Kyu Rhee at Weill Cornell Medicine and Lorenzo Cappello at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. In addition to the research, the successful applicants will receive necessary training for their career development, including in the areas of teaching, mentoring, and grant writing.

The start date is ideally September 2022 but can be flexible. The initial appointment for the position is 2 years, and the continuation beyond the initial appointment will be based on the availability of funds and performance. 

Cornell University sits within the vibrant and beautiful city of Ithaca in upstate New York. Ithaca offers an affordable quality of life and abundant multicultural and outdoor activities. The research environment at Cornell is friendly, highly collaborative, and interdisciplinary with numerous academic opportunities and social events that support early-career researchers.

### Qualifications
- PhD in a quantitative field (e.g., statistics, computer science, computational biology, or related field).
- Experience with methods development for Bayesian inference and their applications.
- Track record of publication appropriate to career stage.
- Strong interest in developing novel approaches to biological problems.
- Programming proficiency in Python, C/C++, R, or other equivalent languages.
- Ability to work effectively with an interdisciplinary team.
- Exemplary oral and written communication skills.
- Previous experience with biological or clinical data preferred but not required.

### To Apply
To apply for the position, please submit the following materials to [Jaehee Kim](mailto:jaehee.kim@cornell.edu). Applications will be reviewed as received, continuing until a suitable applicant is identified.
- Cover letter describing your research interests and past research experiences.
- Current CV.
- Contact information for three professional references.
- Code samples from prior works, preferably publicly accessible (e.g., GitHub) but email attachment acceptable.

We are committed to creating learning, research, and work environments that are inclusive of all forms of diversity. We actively encourage applications from and nominations of individuals from underrepresented groups.
