<br/>

During carcinogenesis, the cancer cell population within an individual undergoes evolutionary processes—such as mutation and natural selection based on the cell’s fitness in the tumor microenvironment—that follow evolutionary population genetics principles, where cancer cells are treated as individuals of a non-sexually reproducing species. The resulting tumor is often a mixture of multiple genetically heterogenous cell subpopulations, contributing to drug resistance and the failure of targeted therapies.

We are developing mathematical models and statistical inference methods for investigating spatiotemporal cancer evolution with special emphasis on metastasis.  In carrying out these aims, we will adopt approaches that blend population genetics, phylodynamics, mathematical biology, machine learning, and bioinformatics methodologies.
