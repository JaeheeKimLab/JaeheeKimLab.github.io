<br/>
Landscape fragmentation---the loss of connectivity between habitable patches---is a key driver of animal and plant population declines, species extinction, and biodiversity losses. Fragmentation alters the genetic composition of populations, increasing genetic differentiation between populations and decreasing within-population genetic diversity. Understanding the population genetic effects of fragmentation is important for evaluating the evolutionary and genetic consequences of fragmentation on populations, for tracking fragmentation processes using genetic monitoring, and for informing conservation and management actions. 

We are developing theoretical and computational frameworks for investigating fragmentation processes, and genetically tracking and monitoring populations. The work capitalizes on recent advances in mathematical population genetics, network theory, and statistics.
