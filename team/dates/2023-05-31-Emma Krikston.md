Hi, my name is Emma Krikston and I am an undergraduate junior studying Computer Science with an external specialization in Biological Sciences. My dream job is to work at a company that applies computer science in genomics to create more personalized medicine in the healthcare field. I love playing soccer for fun, especially during intramural season. My favorite vacation spot is the jersey shore and you can find me there most weekends in the summer!

* Emma is supported by the [BURE](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/uresch/cornell-bowers-cis-undergraduate-research-experience-bure){:target="_blank"} (Cornell Bowers CIS Undergraduate Research Experience) program.
