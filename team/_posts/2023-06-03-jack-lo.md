Hi, I’m Jack! I’m an M.Eng. student in computer science, which I also majored in for my undergraduate degree at Cornell. I like all things CS, from systems and architecture to ML and algorithms, as well as exploring its applications in computational biology. In my free time, I’m currently learning how to play basketball and guitar, so shoot me any tips on dribbling, barre chords, or both!

#### Education 
* 2023 B.S. in Computer Science. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY
