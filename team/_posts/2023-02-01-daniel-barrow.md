Jan 2024â€“present

Hi, I'm Daniel!  I have a Ph.D. in Physics where my research invovled creating simulations of atmospheric dynamics under the influence of ion chemistry and radiative interactions.  In general, I am interested in leveraging computational models to solve complex systems in the natural world and I am particularly fascinated by the intricate problems presented in population genetics and evolutionary biology.  In my spare time I enjoy gaming, reading sci-fi novels, and rock-climbing.

#### Education
