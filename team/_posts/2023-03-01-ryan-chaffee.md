Hi, I’m Ryan! I am a PhD student in Genetics, Genomics, and Development. I am interested in harnessing a variety computational methods to model convoluted problems in population genetics with ecological implications. My previous research focused on simulating tomato breeding to map genes of interest, but I am excited to branch out and explore genomic data in other organisms. My favorite non-science activity is speed-solving NYT crosswords with friends!
