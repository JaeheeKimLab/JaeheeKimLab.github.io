Hi! My name is Edoardo, and I'm a PhD student in Computational Biology. Before coming to Cornell, I worked on analytical and computational methods in statistical mechanics, focusing on reaction–diffusion equations. Over time, my interests shifted toward applying the same approaches to biology. Inspired by physics, I aim to understand the intrinsic complexities of living systems by mathematically describing the interactions among their constituents at smaller scales. In my free time, I enjoy reading, baking and spending time with friends.
