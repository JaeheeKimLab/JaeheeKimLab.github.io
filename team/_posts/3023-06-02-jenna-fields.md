Hi, I’m Jenna. I am a recent graduate interested in using reinforcement learning and other machine learning techniques to better understand and solve biological problems. As an undergraduate at Cornell, I completed an independent major in cognitive science and computer science, culminating in my honors thesis which explored the possible orthogonal relationship between pain and reward using reinforcement learning. I also completed an undergraduate honors thesis in modernist literature, and (while I no longer participate in any formal literary research) I am always up for an informal discussion about books (especially anything by Virginia Woolf).

#### Education 
* 2023 B.A. in Computer Science, College Scholar (magna cum laude), and English (summa cum laude). Cornell University, Ithaca, NY
