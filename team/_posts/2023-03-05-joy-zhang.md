Hi, I’m Joy, a PhD student in Applied Mathematics.

I develop and apply mathematics to answer questions in computational biology. In particular, I strive to improve the mathematical methods commonly used in biological models, such as Bayesian estimation and Monte Carlo simulation, with theories from algebraic geometry and combinatorics, such as toric varieties and matroids, in a way that is specific to biological data.

Outside research, I enjoy distance running, piano, and creative stories.


#### Education 
* 2022 B.A. with Honors in Mathematics and Philosophy, Swarthmore College
