Hi, I’m Ishani! I’m a rising senior majoring in Biological Sciences (CB) and Biometry & Statistics. I’m interested in Bayesian methods, stochastic processes, and statistical applications to genomics. In my free time, I like to explore Ithaca and try new drinks from cafes! I enjoy staying active and learning how to sew and knit.
