Oct 2022–May 2023

I’m a senior studying Computer Science, Computational Biology, and Neuroscience. I’m passionate about applications of machine learning in genomics, neuroscience, and drug discovery. My current research at the Kim Lab focuses on applying deep learning to phylogenetic trees to uncover the epidemiological dynamics underlying the spread of pathogenic diseases. My dream is to found a startup at the intersection of machine learning and biology around a product with the power to save lives.
