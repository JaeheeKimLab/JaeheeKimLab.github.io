* After graduating from Cornell in 2023, Adi is pursuing her studies as a MS student in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University.

I’m a senior studying Computer Science, Computational Biology, and Neuroscience. I’m passionate about applications of machine learning in genomics, neuroscience, and drug discovery. My current research at the Kim Lab focuses on applying deep learning to phylogenetic trees to uncover the epidemiological dynamics underlying the spread of pathogenic diseases. My dream is to found a startup at the intersection of machine learning and biology around a product with the power to save lives.
