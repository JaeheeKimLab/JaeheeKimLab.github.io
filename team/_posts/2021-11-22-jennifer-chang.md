I am a new bioinformatics analyst at the Bedford lab. I co-majored in Computer Science and Biochemistry from Cornell College and went on to get a PhD in Bioinformatics from Iowa State University. My PhD research software led to co-founding a small software startup. After which, I joined Amy Vincent's Lab as an USDA ORISE postdoc and automated the quarterly Influenza A Virus in Swine (IAV-S) survellence reports from 2017-2020. From 2020-21, I spent some time co-designing virtual events to train USDA researches on how to use the HPC and wrap their pipelines in nextflow.

I am excited to be part of this team and automation is very important to me. I enjoy broad collaborations, interesting problems, and book recommendations.
