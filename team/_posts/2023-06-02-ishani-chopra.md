* After graduating from Cornell in 2024, Ishani is pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan.

Hi, I’m Ishani! I’m a rising senior majoring in Biological Sciences (CB) and Biometry & Statistics. I’m interested in Bayesian methods, stochastic processes, and statistical applications to genomics. In my free time, I like to explore Ithaca and try new drinks from cafes! I enjoy staying active and learning how to sew and knit.

* Ishani is supported by the [HHMI-CURT](https://hhmi-curt.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Cornell University Research Transfer Program) program.
